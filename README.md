# Once-upon-a-time-in-Katrineholm
This is a major game project that was done during a course in school. We were a total of 9 people who participated in this project.

## Game
Created using our own game engine, with the graphics api DirectX 11. The game takes place in a forest where the player must follow the road in order to get to the end. The house will follow the road as long as the player is in radius, otherwise the house will stand still. 

Full video of all rendering and graphics techniques or all the gameplay elements can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV2sTs9ZubU

#### My contributions to this project:
- Sprite interactions with mouse in main menu etc. 
- Music and sound effects with xAudio2
- Different gameplay conditions for players different gamebars when picking them up [food, health and fuel]
- Particle systems on both GPU and CPU
- A bunch of models that behave as pickups for health, food and fuel. 
- Did the animations for the enemy "Charger" in the game
